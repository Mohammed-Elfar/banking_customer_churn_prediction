# Banking Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a banking environment using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to customers who stop doing business with the bank,
such as closing their accounts. By predicting churn, banks can identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them. 


## Approach & Steps:
1- Understanding the data variables: This step is important because it allows you to understand the meaning of each variable and how it might be related to the dependent variable and 
delete unnecessary columns in prediction

2- checked if the data types were correct and didnâ€™t need changes, then looked for missing or repeated data.

3- Univariate analysis: In this step i will go through each column and fix problems , look at the distribution of each variable and do Eda for features to understand

4- Creating new features: This step allows you to create new features that are based on the existing features. This can be helpful if you want to improve the accuracy of your model.

5- Identifying the most important variables using diff tests: This step allows you to identify the variables that have the biggest impact on the dependent variable

6- Pipeline Building: A pipeline was created to handle preprocessing, feature engineering, and model integration, ensuring a smooth and consistent workflow for training.

7- Model Building: The model building process utilized a pipeline and cross-validation to train and test multiple models and choose best model, ensuring no data leakage and effective model. A pipeline was established to preprocess data and integrate various models, maintaining a consistent workflow.

8- Tuning: Tune The model using 5- cross-validation and grid search to optimize hyperparameters.
